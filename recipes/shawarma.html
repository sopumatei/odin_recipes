            <p>
                A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
                typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.

            <!-- Steps -->
            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>

                <li>
                    For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a ziplock bag. A bag works best because the chicken remains nicely coated in the marinade. If you prefer to use a container, either turn the chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air, then massage to coat from the outside. Leave to marinade for 12 to 24 hours in the fridge. If you’re pressed for time, even 3 hours will do!
                </li>

                <li>
                    Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great crust on it from the spices, and you will adore the smell. It’s intoxicating!
                </li>

                <li>
                    Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, else they will just run out everywhere when you slice the meat.
                </li>

            </ol>
