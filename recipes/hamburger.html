            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>
                A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
                typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.
            </p>

            <!-- Ingredients -->
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)
                </li>

                <li>
                    Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <!-- Steps -->
            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>

                <li>
                    Set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce,
                    milk, and spices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty
                    mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your favorite hamburger toppings and condiments.
                </li>

            </ol>
