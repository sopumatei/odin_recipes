        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
            typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.
        </p>

        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            
            <li>
                Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.
            </li>

            <li>
                Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)
            </li>

            <li>
                Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.
            </li>

            <li>
                Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.
            </li>

            <li>
                Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>
                Set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce,
                milk, and spices.
            </li>

            <li>
                Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty
                mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.
            </li>

            <li>
                Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your favorite hamburger toppings and condiments.
            </li>

        </ol>
